# Default Privacy

Welcome to Default Privacy, your free, open-source privacy resource center. We believe that everyone deserves to be in control of their digital footprint and have access to the tools and resources they need to protect their online identity and security. Our mission is to empower individuals to take control of their digital lives by providing a comprehensive directory of privacy-preserving tools and resources, including open-source options. We're committed to raising the bar for user privacy and security, and we're just getting started.

## A New Standard

At Default Privacy, we're not just committed to providing a comprehensive directory of privacy-preserving tools and resources - we're also dedicated to setting a new standard for user privacy in the tech industry. Our [DEFAULT PRIVACY POLICY](https://github.com/privatebydefault/Default-Privacy-Policy) and the groundbreaking [DEFAULT LICENSE v1](https://github.com/privatebydefault/Default-License-v1) work together to prioritize user privacy and security. As the first open-source license to put user privacy first, the DEFAULT LICENSE v1 helps to establish a safer internet, and we're proud to be leading the way in this new paradigm.

## Changing the Status Quo

We're revolutionizing the status quo by creating new, privacy-first standards. We're empowering individuals to defend their own privacy, because no one else will do it for them. By providing a safe and trustworthy online environment, we're giving users the freedom to live their lives online without fear of surveillance or exploitation. We're providing a multitude of options and letting users do their own research. We believe in giving people the tools and information they need to make informed decisions about their online security. Our directory is built on open-source principles and transparency, and we're committed to collaboration and community involvement. By working together, we can create a safer and more private online ecosystem for everyone.
