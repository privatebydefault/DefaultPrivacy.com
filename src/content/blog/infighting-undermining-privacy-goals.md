To the Privacy Community,

We have a problem. Our passion for protecting individual freedoms has morphed into an elitism that's driving away newcomers and stifling innovation. We've become hostile to anyone who dares to challenge our views or offer alternative solutions.

This mindset is damaging to our community and counterproductive to our goals. Privacy is a complex issue that requires diverse perspectives and approaches. We should be embracing new ideas, engaging in constructive dialogue, and providing support to those who are just starting to explore the world of privacy.

Instead, we're creating an environment that's intimidating and exclusive. We're alienating users who don't conform to our expectations, making it harder for them to find the resources they need to protect their privacy. This toxic behavior undermines the very principles we're fighting for.

We need to remember that we're not each other's enemies. We're all fighting against a common foe: the surveillance state, the data brokers, and the corporations that seek to exploit our personal information for their own gain. We should be banding together to defend ourselves against these threats, not tearing each other down.

Let's focus on building a united front against those who seek to undermine our privacy. Let's create a community that's inclusive, supportive, and empowering. Let's provide a safe haven for those who are seeking to protect their privacy, and let's offer a beacon of hope for those who are fighting against the forces of surveillance and control.

As the founder of a project that's been impacted by these issues, I've seen the difference that a supportive community can make. Let's put our differences aside and focus on what unites us. Let's create a community that's a powerful force for good, dedicated to defending our right to privacy and promoting a safer, more secure world for all.

Sincerely,

Default Privacy Team
