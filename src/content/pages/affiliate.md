At DefaultPrivacy.com, we're passionate about empowering individuals to take control of their online presence and protect their digital rights. We're committed to transparency and ethical practices. It's important for us to disclose our affiliate relationships with our users to maintain the trust that many other companies have lost. We partner with companies that align with our values and mission to promote online freedom and privacy. We earn a commission on some of the products and services we recommend, but our recommendations are based on our genuine assessment of their value, not just because of the commission. We clearly label our affiliate links and welcome feedback from our users.

#### Support Our Mission

If you'd like to support our mission, there are several ways you can do so. If you're able to contribute financially, a donation would be greatly appreciated. Alternatively, you can help us out by clicking on our affiliate links - it's a free and easy way to show your support. Sharing our site with friends and family is also a great way to help us spread the word and continue our work.

When you see an affiliate link on our site, it means we may earn a small commission if you make a purchase through that link. The cost to you remains the same or possibly reduces your cost, while helping us continue providing valuable resources. We clearly mark affiliate links with the word "affiliate" so you know which links earn us a commission. By clicking on these links, you help us cover the costs of maintaining our site and creating more content. This allows us to continue advocating for online freedom and privacy.

#### Our Affiliate Policy

We're committed to transparency and ethical practices in our affiliate relationships. We believe that transparency and ethics are essential in affiliate relationships, and we're committed to maintaining the highest standards in our partnerships. Here's a breakdown of our affiliate policy:

* **Transparency**: We clearly label our affiliate links so you know which links earn us a commission.
* **Voluntary Support**: Using our affiliate link is entirely your choice. Clicking it helps support us, but you are not obligated to do so.
* **No Bias**: Our recommendations are based on our genuine assessment of the product or service, not just because of the affiliate commission.
* **Review**: If we find that an affiliate no longer meets our standards, we'll terminate the relationship and remove their links from our site.

#### How We Choose Affiliates

We're selective about the services and products we partner with, and we only choose those that align with our values and meet our strict criteria. We carefully evaluate each potential affiliate to ensure that they meet our strict criteria, which includes a review of their products or services, their business practices, and their commitment to transparency and accountability. Before partnering with any affiliate, we ask ourselves:

* Does the affiliate align with our mission to promote digital freedom?
* Would we genuinely recommend this to our friends and family?
* Does this service or product benefit our audience?
* Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations that we need to disclose?
* Does the affiliate prioritize user privacy and security, and do they have a track record of transparency and accountability?
* Does the affiliate support open-source initiatives and contribute to the development of decentralized technologies?

#### Our Commitment

We're dedicated to maintaining our independence, integrity, transparency and ethical practices. We're committed to maintaining our independence and integrity by regularly reviewing our affiliate relationships and ensuring that they align with our values and mission. We also welcome feedback from our users and encourage them to hold us accountable for our actions. Our affiliate links do not influence our content or recommendations. If you ever feel that our recommendations are biased, please let us know. We reserve the right to terminate any affiliate relationship if we feel that it no longer aligns with our values.
