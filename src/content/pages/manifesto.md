We're at a critical moment in the history of the internet. The path we choose will decide whether we'll be living in a world of constant surveillance and exploitation, or one where our private lives are truly private. We believe the internet should be a tool that sets us free, not one that controls us.

To make this vision a reality, we must take responsibility for our digital freedom. By normalizing privacy, we can shift the conversation from "what do you have to hide?" to "what do you have to protect?" Recognize that personal data is a valuable asset worth safeguarding.

At our core, we believe in autonomy, anonymity, and decentralization. Encryption and anonymity are basic human rights essential to our online independence. A decentralized internet, free from government and corporate control, is crucial.

It's time to take action. Stand together against those who undermine privacy. We won't be fooled by the idea that privacy is a luxury or that security means sacrificing autonomy. Rise to the challenge and build a world where autonomy, anonymity, and decentralization thrive.
